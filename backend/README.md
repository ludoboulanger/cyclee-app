# Getting Started

### API

#### Startup commands

To build the application, use: `./gradlew build` in the `./backend` directory. This will run the test suit and build the application as well as create the JAR file necessary for containerizing the application.

To start the application use : `./gradlew bootRun` in the backend directory. This starts an Apache Tomcat server on port `8080`.

To view a list of tasks that, run `./gradlew tasks`.

#### Health check

To see if the api is healthy, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`. If you see a `{status: UP}`, then the API as weel as all the services are running properly.

#### Documentation

API documentation can be found at `http://localhost:8080/docs/swagger.html`. This is a web page that displays all possible routes and allows to test requests.
